    "this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi": 1,

    "what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro in his most overdone performance and thats saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood and mr scorcese especially attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back in any case this movie is awful": 0,

    "almost every review of this movie id seen was pretty bad its not pretty bad its actually pretty good though not great the judy garland character could have gotten annoying but she didnt allow it to somewhere along the line ive become a fan of brooding overbearing overacting van heflin at least in the early 40s judys singing is great but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship i gave it a 7": 1,
    "what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you dont look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up": 1,

    "this a superb selfcontained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this lawfree world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact its a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation  highpoints include billy idols british loutishness ben londons vulturine brassware kyles squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies": 1,

    "eddie murphys delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of standup eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes  forget it unless you happen to enjoy eddies foul style i dont think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script  saturday january 17 1998  video": 0,

    "in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8": 1,
    "i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to cb4 i was blown away i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great way better than cb4 the characters the songs the plot everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by siskel and egbert and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick you know its good": 1,

    "the video quality is awful the sound quality is pathetic the acting is horrific the dialog is painful the lighting is dismal the editing is laughable i could go on but it would be pointless snitchd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin": 0,
    "bleak house is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen alway one of my favorite novelsi was exteremely pleased with this television mini series the late great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the bookoly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story over all a brilliantmoving and atmosphereic film": 1,
    "this film came recommended as a good action film which i dont really think it is i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow there really isnt that much action until the end of the film and its pretty dark and hard to see whats really happening i was sure hoping for something different but alas didnt find it here": 0,
    "this was one of the best war movies ive seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters": 1,
    "story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while all the action is in the end but you wont have to laugh because the movie is funny but because the story is pathetic  the funniest part is when harvey im not paranoia keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre oscars for this guy": 0,
    "excellent gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the womans role and place a moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences low budget independent film never made any money definitely not the romanticized unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life": 1,
    "one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in esoteric please dont watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful faade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon andreas marschalls first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few euros im waiting for the second hit": 1,

    "ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of streamofconsciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining": 1,
    "witty and disgusting brash and intelligent baseketball redefines comedysports with a pot spoof of an easy target makes other so called comedies like dead boring one of the best of all time trey parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection": 1,

    "i did not set very high expectations for this movie which left me pleasantly surprised the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies this may not be the best movie ever but its uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future": 1,
    "wonderful actors   lousy script and not too great direction either my main problem was i simply didnt care about any of these people not the killer not the victims the settings were pretty drab dennis quaids character was so poorly written in i didnt even care when the end came he got his kid back big deal i wanted my money back": 0,
    "i had always been a big lynda carterwonder woman fan so when the scifi channel ran this moviei had to see iti was bitterly disappointedthis is a wonder woman movie in name onlyshe doesnt wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor mans james bondtheres none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success ie the superhuman strength or determined willits just one long bad dreami dont even think cathy is all that attractive anywayi wouldnt waste your time on this": 0,
    "a very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his successthe most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great swimmer and had a great shout": 1,

    "this is a really heartwarming family movie it has absolutely brilliant animal training and acting if you can call it like that as well just think about the dog in how the grinch stole christmas it was plain bad training the paulie story is extremely well done well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too not more to say except that this is a great movie  my ratings story 8510 acting 7510 animalsfx 8510 cinematography 810  my overall rating 810  big family movie and very worth watching": 1,
    "i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way  mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply cant get over the fact that she is even in such a piece  stupid stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental": 0,

    "one of the best ensemble acted films ive ever seen there isnt much to the plot but the acting incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted": 1,

    "my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actorsactresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasnt that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburns last movies ill always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here": 0,
    "good performances cant save this terrible script larded with every cliche in the chickflick book both main characters are deeply unsympathetic and the scene where laura linneys character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son  which i think is supposed to be poignant  is just horrifying": 0,
    "i would have to say that this is the first quality romanticcomedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they wont get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent": 1,
    "henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasnt real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself": 1,

    "hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show   yes it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard hunter the ateam etc etc etc  this show is just good clean television the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing they often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show it contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesnt enjoy a good car chase especially with the coyote   i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this": 1,
    "proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without quentins involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years thats assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor": 0,
    "i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film not to mention surprised i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr the performance was so finely nuanced neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro not the babyfaced mr mohr a very impressive performance indeed and its gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky indie films": 1,
    "i first saw this movie on mst3k and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes i dont particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcocklike plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the nonmst3k version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake": 0,
    "i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture  justine priestley is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original slants on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of amandas affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off": 1,
    "a good picture is worth all the words this film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with downs syndrome and i wont spoil it by telling you youll want to see it yourself  pasqual duquenne is an amazing actor i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning  the film has a magic of its own after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love passion and simplicity is all we need": 1,
